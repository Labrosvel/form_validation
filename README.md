# form_validation

In this practice project I did the following:
* Created a basic web form
* Used the <script> tag
* Added a JavaScript function
* Accessed the form controls from JavaScript
* Accessed a textbox and checked if it was blank
* Executed a set of statements based on a condition
* Displayed error messages
* Executed a function when the form was submitted
